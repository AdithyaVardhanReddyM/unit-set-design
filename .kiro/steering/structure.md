```

## Architecture Patterns

### Route Groups

- Use parentheses for route groups that don't affect URL structure: `(auth)`

### Authentication Flow

- Clerk handles authentication UI and session management
- Convex integrates with Clerk via JWT tokens
- `ConvexProviderWithClerk` wraps the app to sync auth state

### Provider Hierarchy

```
ClerkProvider
  └─ ThemeProvider
      └─ ConvexClientProvider
          └─ CanvasProvider (on canvas pages)
              └─ App Content
              └─ Toaster (notifications)
```

### Canvas Architecture

- Canvas uses React Context + useReducer for state management
- Two separate reducers: viewport (pan/zoom) and shapes (drawing entities)
- Normalized entity state for shapes: `{ ids: string[], entities: Record<string, Shape> }`
- RAF throttling for performance optimization
- Auto-save to localStorage with 1-second debounce
- Custom DOM events for shape resizing

### Component Conventions

- UI components in `/components/ui` are from shadcn/ui
- Use "use client" directive for client components
- Custom providers go in `/components` root
- Page components use Server Components by default

### Styling Approach

- Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- Use `cn()` utility from `@/lib/utils` for conditional classes
- Component variants managed with class-variance-authority
- Default theme: dark mode with system preference support

### Type Safety

- Strict TypeScript configuration
- Convex generates types automatically in `/_generated`
- Use proper typing for all components and functions
